## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## About Laravel7-starterkit

When I started to develop websites using the laravel framework, like everyone else I had to learn the basics. 
But at one point I wanted to have a basic project that would allow me to gain productivity since several of my 
projects had common functionalities. My goal in making this starter kit is to offer a basic project to any developer
 in order to save time and allow them to focus on the business features of the application they want to develop. 
 This project will be under permanent construction and any idea will be welcome. Please forgive me for my rough English, 
 French is my first language.
